# Homework 11

Perform the following query scenarios through the DVDRENTAL sample database.

1. Let's sort all data for the first_name columns in the Actor and Customer tables.
    ```
    (
	SELECT first_name FROM actor
    )
    UNION ALL
    (
        SELECT first_name FROM customer
    );
    ```
2. Let's sort the intersecting data for the first_name columns in the Actor and Customer tables.
    ```
    (
	SELECT first_name FROM actor
    )
    INTERSECT
    (
        SELECT first_name FROM customer
    );
    ```
3. For the first_name columns in the Actor and Customer tables, let's list the data found in the first table but not in the second table.
    ```
    (
	SELECT first_name FROM actor
    )
    EXCEPT
    (
        SELECT firsst_name FROM customer
    );
    ```
